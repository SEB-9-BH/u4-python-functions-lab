## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/labs` directory:

cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `python-functions-lab`.

Clone a copy of your remote repo locally by using the `git clone` command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-functions-lab.git
```

> 📚 Note: In the link above, where it says `<your-username>`, you should see the username from your GitHub account.

Next, `cd` into your new cloned directory, `python-functions-lab`:

```bash
cd python-functions-lab
```

Create a file for the lesson:

```bash
touch exercises.py
```

Open the project's folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
